**PWAs** have full access to Windows 10 functionality APIs and can be installed on the entire UWP family of devices (including more secure Windows 10 devices in S mode) while ensuring compatibility with other browsers and devices.

In short, you can deploy PWA on Microsoft Store and Google play. PWA works everywhere, whether your users are on a Surface Book, an Android, an iPad, an Xbox One, a TV, a mac OS, an iOS, a windows, a Linux system. **Only once for all platforms.**
