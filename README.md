Did you know that Steve Jobs was the one who had the idea to transform web applications into native applications. In 2007 Steve Jobs introduced the visionary idea of ​​web applications “that look exactly like and behave exactly like native applications.”
It was not until 2015 that this idea was brought to fruition by Chrome developer Alex Russell and designer Frances Berriman. Since then, the biggest players like Google and Microsoft have promoted the concept of PWA as a way to bridge the gap between the Web and native apps.
