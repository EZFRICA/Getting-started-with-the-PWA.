# PWA
From zero to hero with PWA.

Did you know that Steve Jobs was the one who had the idea to transform web applications into native applications. In 2007 Steve Jobs introduced the visionary idea of ‚Äã‚Äãweb applications ‚Äúthat look exactly like and behave exactly like native applications.‚Äù
It was not until 2015 that this idea was brought to fruition by Chrome developer Alex Russell and designer Frances Berriman. Since then, the biggest players like Google and Microsoft have promoted the concept of PWA as a way to bridge the gap between the Web and native apps.

In short, you can deploy PWA on Microsoft Store and Google play. PWA works everywhere, whether your users are on a Surface Book, an Android, an iPad, an Xbox One, a TV, a mac OS, an iOS, a windows, a Linux system. Only once for all platforms.
Now that we know the history of the pwa, we will see the different tools and resources necessary to create a pwa.
